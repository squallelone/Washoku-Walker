# Washoku-Walker

## About

Washoku Walker is an app that lets user find restaurants in Japan.

Users who want to find a specific food can get a selection of restaurants by dish and area. For dish types, users can either select from a list of curated traditional Japanese dishes or input the dish of their choice. Similarly, the area field allows users to either search by one of the 23 Tokyo wards or any place of their liking. Users without any specific dish or area preference can opt to get a selection of restaurant recommendations within a 1.5 km radius of the current location.
